# Pentagon-AES Hybrid Encryption Method

Pentagon-AES Hybrid is an experimental, educational encryption algorithm inspired by the Pentagon shape and AES, featuring a 512-bit key and 10-25 iterative rounds.

## Overview

This custom-designed encryption method aims to provide an understanding of cryptography concepts and to explore the potential of combining different encryption elements. The algorithm incorporates AES operations such as SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey.

**Note:** This encryption method is for educational purposes and not recommended for securing sensitive information in real-world applications. Use established encryption algorithms like AES, RSA, or ECC instead.

## Algorithm Steps

Please refer to the [documentation](./documentation.md) for a detailed description of the algorithm steps, including key generation, data preparation, data assignment, data transformation, final round, and decryption process.
